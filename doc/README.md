# LeafXML documentation folder

This directory contains documentation files in Markdown format:

- `LeafXML.md` is a full decoding specification of the LeafXML format.
- `Encoding.md` contains encoding guidelines for the LeafXML format.
- `API_Perl.md` documents the Perl API of the LeafXML library.
- `API_JS.md` documents the JavaScript API of the LeafXML library.

In addition to the documentation in this directory, also see the main project `README.md` in the root directory of this distribution.  There is also Perl POD documentation within the Perl source files, which have also been compiled to Markdown within the `perl/pod` directory.  The JavaScript source files also have extensive documentation within their comments.
